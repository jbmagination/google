<h1>Inventions Project</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hey there! You're probably coming here from the project, but you also may be coming here from the GitHub repository I just made to set this up... Like I said, leave me alone unless you're actually from my school lol</p>
<p>But for those who DID come from the project, welcome! I suppose that works cited is kind of important, isn't it? Here, <a href="https://jbmagination.com/google/cite">take this!</a></p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Guidelines</h2>
<p>* The video is 2 minutes and 23 seconds long</p>
<p>* I attempted to use as much information from my research as possible without exceeding the time limit</p>
<p>* Every image used relates to what I'm discussing</p>
<p>* I wrote the script by hand myself, you can read it yourself <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LjfZ4Nx2dn7aookxe5tAjmOA8uY1Z7_IYkBz8h9Ux4E/edit">here</a></p>
<p>* The works cited don't fit in the video length, so as such I've included it <a href="https://jbmagination.com/google/cite">here</a></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Finishing the End</h2>
<p>I kept the end in this way to keep my project down to the maximum of 2 minutes and 30 seconds, and also because some of the information I'm going to provide is NOT related to Google. However, it is related to the discussion. If you're interested and would like to keep reading, please see the Google Doc here [not set up yet, sorry!]</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Maybe more?</h2>
<p>This might be updated more often, I don't know. If I change this, I will let you know in class.</p>
